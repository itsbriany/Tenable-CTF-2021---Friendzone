# Tenable-CTF-2021 - Friendzone

Here, you can access the source code for the Tenable CTF 2021 Friendzone Challenge.
The challenge of this objective was to read a VIP user's profile through some obscure vulnerability.

If you wish to walkthrough this challenge with me, I have created a written writeup on [my blog](https://blog.r0kithax.com/ctf/appsec/2021/02/08/tenable-ctf-friendzone.html) and a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/DZDRyf_f8XM) explaining my process and methodology to solving this challenge.
